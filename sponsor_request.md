Hi good day, I am research-assistant at my university, Been looking into build open source farming solution that specifically works on Malaysia first. Me with my team would like to quickly get our concepts tested and proven and proceed to a journal as white paper based on our POC and finding. I am looking a way to get sponsored to obtain the agriculture kit which contains end-node and gateway. Hoping forward for a reply to discuss further in details
